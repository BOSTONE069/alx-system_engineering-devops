Configuration management with Puppet


Configuration management is a process that helps organizations configure, maintain, correct, and ensure that computer systems and hardware remain in a desired state â€” without needing to track every change manually.

Puppet is a software configuration management tool which includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. It is a model-driven solution that requires limited programming knowledge to use. Puppet is produced by Puppet, Inc, founded by Luke Kanies in 2005.
